# Sakshi Kumar's Data Science & Analytics Portfolio

Hi, I‚Äôm Sakshi üèñÔ∏è  
I specialize in marketing science, product analytics, and experimentation ‚Äî turning messy datasets into insights and frameworks that guide real business decisions.  
This portfolio highlights anonymized case studies from my work across consulting, SaaS, and digital marketing.

## üìä Retention & Funnel Analytics (Consumer Loyalty Platform)
**Problem:** Identify where customers drop off in the loyalty journey and improve campaign ROI.  
**Approach:**  
- Built SQL pipelines + Python cohort analysis.  
- Designed retention heatmaps and funnel journeys (sign-up ‚Üí claim ‚Üí redeem).  
- Combined GA4 data with reward engagement logs.  
**Outcome:**  
Pinpointed steep 1st-month drop-offs, identified seasonal retention trends, and highlighted UX bottlenecks (only 6% claim ‚Üí redemption).

## üîç SEO + Engagement Modeling (Digital Agency Case Study)
**Problem:** Organic search attracted users but retention was low. Client wanted to identify high-intent keywords that drive engagement, not just traffic.  
**Approach:**  
- Merged GA4 + GSC + Ahrefs datasets.  
- Built logistic regression + Lasso models to rank keywords by engagement probability.  
- Visualized feature importance (CTR, impressions, intent).  
**Outcome:**  
Identified 7 high-opportunity geo-keywords, optimized localized SEO strategy, and boosted engagement conversion visibility.

## üìà Marketing Mix Modeling (Global CPG Client)
**Problem:** Quantify media ROI and guide ¬£3M+ cross-market spend allocation.  
**Approach:**  
- Developed econometric models (regression + UCMs) in Python.  
- Automated MMM workflows and standardized scenario simulations.  
- Embedded outputs into optimization platform with custom business rules.  
**Outcome:**  
Improved allocation accuracy, increased ROI by 13%, and improved forecast reliability by 8%.

## üíû MatchMadeinML (Vector Search for Dating Profiles)
**Problem:** Build a system that recommends compatible dating profiles based on interests and personality traits.  
**Approach:**  
- Implemented **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient nearest-neighbor lookups.  
- Engineered embeddings from user profiles (text + categorical features).  
- Designed matching pipeline with Python + FAISS to handle high-dimensional vectors.  
**Outcome:**  
Created a proof-of-concept matching engine that returns top-k compatible profiles in milliseconds, demonstrating how vector similarity search powers recommendation systems.

## ü§ñ Conversational AI Chatbot (NLP Project)
**Problem:** Design a chatbot capable of detecting user intent and providing contextually relevant responses ‚Äî a core challenge in healthcare and customer support applications.  

**Approach:**  
- Developed a pipeline combining **NLP classification + response generation**.  
- Fine-tuned a transformer-based language model on a labeled dataset of mental-health dialogues.  
- Implemented **multi-class classification** for user states (e.g., Normal, Stress, Anxiety, Depression).  
- Integrated **multi-turn dialogue handling** with conversation state tracking.  
- Evaluated performance with **precision, recall, F1-score**, ensuring reliable predictions.  

**Outcome:**  
Built a proof-of-concept **mental health support chatbot** that detects user intent and provides empathetic responses. Demonstrated skills in **deep learning, text classification, and conversational AI design**. The framework is adaptable to other domains (e.g., customer service or product support).

## üó∫Ô∏è SF Crime Aware Navigator (Streamlit + Kafka App)
**Problem:** Urban travelers often lack real-time visibility into neighborhood safety. Our team set out to design a tool that could forecast risk on walking routes and surface live incident data.  

**Approach:**  
- I built the **Streamlit app** frontend, integrating routing (OpenRouteService API), map overlays, and interactive controls.  
- Connected a pre-trained ML model for route risk prediction.  
- Integrated **Kafka event producers** to simulate live crime incidents streaming into the app sidebar.  
- Packaged everything into a lightweight UI recruiters and stakeholders could run locally.  

**Outcome:**  
Delivered a working prototype where users can:  
- Enter start & end points ‚Üí receive a predicted safety score and suggested safer routes.  
- See **live-streaming incidents** update in real time.  
- Explore how data pipelines (Kafka + ML) connect to a user-facing dashboard.
