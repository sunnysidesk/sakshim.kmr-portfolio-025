## üìä Retention & Funnel Analytics (Consumer Loyalty Platform)
**Problem:** Identify where customers drop off in the loyalty journey and improve campaign ROI.  
**Approach:**  
- Built SQL pipelines + Python cohort analysis.  
- Designed retention heatmaps and funnel journeys (sign-up ‚Üí claim ‚Üí redeem).  
- Combined GA4 data with reward engagement logs.  
**Outcome:**  
Pinpointed steep 1st-month drop-offs, identified seasonal retention trends, and highlighted UX bottlenecks (only 6% claim ‚Üí redemption).

## üîç SEO + Engagement Modeling (Digital Agency Case Study)
**Problem:** Organic search attracted users but retention was low. Client wanted to identify high-intent keywords that drive engagement, not just traffic.  
**Approach:**  
- Merged GA4 + GSC + Ahrefs datasets.  
- Built logistic regression + Lasso models to rank keywords by engagement probability.  
- Visualized feature importance (CTR, impressions, intent).  
**Outcome:**  
Identified 7 high-opportunity geo-keywords, optimized localized SEO strategy, and boosted engagement conversion visibility.

## üìà Marketing Mix Modeling (Global CPG Client)
**Problem:** Quantify media ROI and guide ¬£3M+ cross-market spend allocation.  
**Approach:**  
- Developed econometric models (regression + UCMs) in Python.  
- Automated MMM workflows and standardized scenario simulations.  
- Embedded outputs into optimization platform with custom business rules.  
**Outcome:**  
Improved allocation accuracy, increased ROI by 13%, and improved forecast reliability by 8%.  
**Artifacts:** [Example Notebook Snippet](link)

## üíû MatchMadeinML (Vector Search for Dating Profiles)
**Problem:** Build a system that recommends compatible dating profiles based on interests and personality traits.  
**Approach:**  
- Implemented **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient nearest-neighbor lookups.  
- Engineered embeddings from user profiles (text + categorical features).  
- Designed matching pipeline with Python + FAISS to handle high-dimensional vectors.  
**Outcome:**  
Created a proof-of-concept matching engine that returns top-k compatible profiles in milliseconds, demonstrating how vector similarity search powers recommendation systems.

## ü§ñ Conversational AI Chatbot (NLP Homework Project)
**Problem:** Build a chatbot capable of understanding user queries and generating contextually relevant responses.  
**Approach:**  
- Fine-tuned a transformer-based language model (BioBERT/GPT-like architecture) on a mental-health dialogue dataset.  
- Implemented multi-class classification for user intent (e.g., Normal, Stress, Anxiety).  
- Added response generation module + evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1).  
- Extended to multi-turn dialogue handling using conversation state tracking.  
**Outcome:**  
Built a proof-of-concept mental health chatbot that detects user intent and provides empathetic responses. Demonstrated ability to integrate NLP modeling, classification, and response generation into one pipeline.  
**Artifacts:** [Notebook](link)
